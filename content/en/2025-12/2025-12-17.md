2.  **Nvidia launches its Nemotron 3 Series.**
    The Nemotron 3 series from Nvidia includes three 🔥 open-source models: **Nano (with 30 billion parameters)**, Super, and Ultra. These models utilize a Mamba-Transformer hybrid MoE architecture. Specifically, the Nemotron 3 Nano [activates with just 3.2 billion parameters](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-16-7), yet it boasts a **4x throughput improvement** over its predecessor and supports millions of tokens in context. You can grab it now on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nvidia), which comes bundled with the 3-trillion-token training dataset, Taobao-MM, and the NeMo Gym reinforcement learning library.

3.  **ChatGPT introduces a new branch chat feature. 💬**
    OpenAI has rolled out its 🎨 branch conversation feature on both iOS and Android. This cool new tool lets users create multiple parallel conversation branches, allowing them to [explore new directions based on the original discussion](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23721).

This dramatically boosts image editing 💡 precision. <br/>![AI News: Gemini Image Tagging Feature Operation Demo Interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kckzvmj3e50vr77yws99xq4d.avif)<br/>

### Frontier Research

1.  **Peking University Physics Department reveals LLM dynamics. 🔬**
    A team from Peking University's School of Physics has, for the first time, uncovered a **delicate balance phenomenon** 🔥 in LLM generation, leveraging the [Principle of Least Action](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-16-8). Their research indicates that LLMs generate content by implicitly learning potential functions rather than strict rule sets, behaving much like thermodynamic equilibrium systems. Interestingly, Claude-4 tends to converge quickly, while GPT-5 Nano prefers exploring the state space. This groundbreaking theory elevates AI research from what was once "alchemy" to a 💡 quantifiable science.

2.  **Harvard analyzes Perplexity usage data. 📊**
    [Harvard research](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pnf368/its_been_a_big_week_for_agentic_ai_here_are_10/), based on hundreds of millions of queries, reveals some interesting insights into Perplexity usage. It shows that **55% of users are for personal use**, with 30% for professional scenarios. Productivity/workflow makes up a solid **36%** 🚀 of queries, while learning and research account for 21%. Over time, users are shifting from simple tasks to more complex ones, painting a true picture of how Agents are being used.

3.  **Stanford unveils a multimodal DiffFusion framework. 💡**
    This new framework leverages diffusion models to achieve [3D Object Detection in Adverse Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13107) ☔. Diffusion-IR tackles image repair, PCR compensates LiDAR data, and the BAFAM module handles dynamic multimodal fusion and bidirectional BEV alignment. It's showcased **optimal robustness** across three major public datasets 🤖, with zero-shot testing impressively demonstrating its generalization capability.

4.  **New research on Causal LLMs for text classification. 📑**
    This [research comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12677) delves into two fine-tuning strategies: embedded and instructive. The embedded method, combining 4-bit quantization and LoRA, was used to train an 8B parameter model on a single GPU, yielding significantly better F1 scores than the instructive method 🚀. Its performance even outshines domain-specific models like BERT on proprietary datasets and the WIPO-Alpha multi-label task.

5.  **Google Cloud unveils AlphaEvolve. 🚀**
    AlphaEvolve, a [Gemini-driven coding agent](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pnf368/its_been_a_big_week_for_agentic_ai_here_are_10/) 🔥, is Google Cloud's latest offering, specifically focused on advanced algorithm design. It uses LLMs to suggest code modifications, with a feedback loop designed to evolve algorithm efficiency 💡. Currently in private preview, it promises to significantly boost code quality.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

5.  **Former CIA official brings up remote control tools again. 🕵️‍♂️**
    Former CIA official Kiriakou claims in a [LADbible video](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46276875) that intelligence agencies can remotely control phones, TVs, and cars 🔒. However, discussions on Hacker News quickly pointed out that this is merely a reiteration of the 2017 Vault 7 leak, not fresh evidence. Commenters questioned Kiriakou's technical relevance and the media's tendency towards sensationalism 💡, advising the public to refer to the original leaked documents instead of personal statements.

### Social Media Shares

1.  **Observation: Alibaba's agentification efforts. 🧐**
    A recent [community discussion](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6941451728fa6ac7346dfd22) highlights that Ant Group products are the most aggressive in agentification 🚀 because their tool-centric nature prioritizes results over process. Taobao's agentification, however, needs to balance "entry point" advertising revenue 💡, while WeChat's enthusiasm for agentification is lower due to its reliance on "usage process" interaction. Users suggest this isn't strategic restraint, but rather a limitation imposed by their commercial models.

2.  **The ironic automation of AI supervision. 🎭**
    A [1983 paper](https://x.com/dotey/status/2000796152921293156) eerily predicted automation problems that are now surfacing with AI Agents 🔥, including skill degradation, memory extraction dilemmas, and monitoring fatigue. The paper underscores that training can't replace real-world experience 💡, and humans struggle to stay vigilant when AI makes mistakes. The absolute worst part? The AI interface is dubbed "the worst anomaly detection design," with fatal errors often hidden within verbose text.

3.  **Claude Code's new confirmation mechanism. ✅**
    A [user's share](https://x.com/hongming731/status/2000727149750427898) highlights how comfortable the interactive experience of Claude Code's new version confirmation mechanism is 🎨. Before executing, the agent presents a detailed operation preview, allowing users to review and confirm each item 💡, which is super helpful in preventing accidental modifications. <br/>![AI News: Claude Code Confirmation Mechanism Operation Interface Preview Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kckzw3pse4xsm09bvt7x2e6n.avif)<br/>

4.  **AGI discussions shouldn't be dismissed as sci-fi. 🧠**
    A recent [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1po1393/dismissing_discussion_of_agi_as_science_fiction/) argues that writing off AGI discussions as mere "science fiction" is "completely unserious" 🔥. Even skeptical experts believe AGI could realistically be achieved in the next ten to twenty years 💡, which is a far cry from truly sci-fi concepts like time travel or Martians. <br/>![AI News: AGI Timeline Expert Prediction Distribution Comparison Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kckzw6gveaqs57dxqkqyqrx2.avif)<br/>
