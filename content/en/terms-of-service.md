# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! By accessing or using our services, you're agreeing to and accepting these Terms of Service. So, before you dive in, please give them a careful read.

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users paid subscription content and member services, including (but not limited to) blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some of this awesome content is exclusively for our subscribed users! 💡

## 2. User Registration & Account
*   Users are required to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
*   Users are responsible for the security of their account and all activities that occur under it. Seriously, **do not** transfer or share your account with anyone. 🚫
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with all fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (such as Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site **does not** store your payment information directly, keeping it super secure! 🔒
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   Our **14-day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: First-time subscribers who aren't stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase can request a full refund. Just shoot us an email via the contact address at the end of these terms and let us know why you're not satisfied. Keep in mind, this is a one-time offer per user. For purchases made after 14 days or by non-first-time subscribers, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless otherwise mandated by law.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express authorization.
*   Users are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** content for personal learning and reading.
*   If you need content for commercial use or extensive citation, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Seriously, **do not** upload, post, or spread any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon the rights of others.
*   Also, **do not** use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or otherwise crack our member content. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   The Site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will absolutely **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice to you.
*   If content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure, server outages, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **will not be held liable for compensation**. Bummer, we know! 😔

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided on the Site is strictly for reference purposes and **does not constitute** any form of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical guidance).
*   The Site **will not be held responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might incur from using our content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between us. If we can't sort it out that way, you agree to submit the dispute to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.
